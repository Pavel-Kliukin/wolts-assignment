## About the project

In this project I tried not only to implement basic functionality, but also to make it a little non-standard and funny.  

As for the functionality, I decided to perform input validation using regular expressions in such a way that the user simply cannot enter incorrect values, such as negative numbers, numbers with leading zeros, or fractional numbers where this is not intended.
